              The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and
              measures about 90 km (56 mi) east to west and 25 km (16 mi) north
              to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40 m (131 ft). Chiba
              Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa
              to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further
              subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and
              the Tama area stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65
              (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than
              Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41) and New York City (40.71). Also
              within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two
              island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu
              Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000
              km (620 mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and
              the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population
              density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban
              and suburban regions of Tokyo.[47] Under Japanese law, Tokyo is
              designated as a to, translated as metropolis. Its administrative
              structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23
              special wards, which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are
              self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and
              the status of a city. In addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo
              also includes 26 more cities, five towns, and eight villages, each
              of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government
              administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards
              and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is
              headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly.
              Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.
