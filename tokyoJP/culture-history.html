            <h3>Bombing of Tokyo</h3>
            <p>
              In 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to
              form the "Metropolitan Prefecture" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo
              Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government
              for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo,
              for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked
              widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent
              Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The
              bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed
              between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of
              the city destroyed. The deadliest night of the war came on March
              9–10, 1945, the night of the American "Operation Meetinghouse"
              raid; as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern
              half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths
              of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings
              were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more
              were injured. Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's
              capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with
              the majority of those who lost their homes living in "ramshackle,
              makeshift huts".

            <h3>Festivals</h3>
            <p>
              Many different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events
              include the Sannō at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and
              the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with
              elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on
              the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the
              Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms
              bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira
              Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the
              blossoms. Harajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known
              internationally for its youth style, fashion and cosplay. Cuisine
              in Tokyo is internationally acclaimed. In November 2007, Michelin
              released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191
              stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest
              competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been
              awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the
              maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and
              161 earned one star.
