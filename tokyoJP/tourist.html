              Deciding what to do and see in Tokyo depends on how much time you
              have—and for your sake, we hope you have a month. The city’s
              streets can feel like a game of soccer played at hyper-speed,
              while calmer attractions range from temples, museums, gardens,
              origami classes, and bohemian sojourns. Tokyo has more than enough
              going on to put you in a tizzy, so a few words of advice: Arrive
              with a game plan and prepare to get a bit lost along the way, in a
              good way. Here, the very best things to do in Tokyo. (Editors
              note: Given the changing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
              hours and accessibility of many places are fluid and subject to
              change. Make sure to contact them before visiting.)

            <h3>Yayoi Kusama Museum</h3>
            <p>
              In a suburban part of Shinjuku, a smooth white building rises five
              stories high—a museum completely devoted to the works of Yayoi
              Kusama. The building looks slim, but it houses a bulk of the
              larger-than-life and avant-garde artist's pieces, including a new
              installation of her “infinity room” series (an Instagram sensation
              which, in the past, drew hundreds of thousands of visitors in
              stateside exhibitions) to polka-dotted paintings and sculptures.
              Currently, to reduce the spread of coronavirus, entry is limited
              to 40 people per 90-minute admission slot.
            </p>

            <h3>Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden</h3>
            <p>
              Fancy a stroll in a Japanese garden? Get that and more at Shinjuku
              Gyoen. In addition to native, traditional gardens, the 144-acre
              park pockets French Formal and English Landscape gardens, all of
              which are worth the modest entrance fee. Landmarks are stunning
              and impossible to forget, like a Taiwan Pavilion perched along a
              serene pond. Formerly an imperial garden, it became a national
              garden after World War II—so you can trust that this precious plot
              is always beautifully maintained. Don't miss cherry blossom
              season.
