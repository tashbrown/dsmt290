              Tokyo is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis.
              It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central
              city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the
              city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.
              Prior to 1868, Tokyo was known as Edo. A small castle town in the
              16th century, Edo became Japan's political center in 1603 when
              Tokugawa Ieyasu established his feudal government there. A few
              decades later, Edo had grown into one of the world's most populous
              cities. Large parts of Tokyo were destroyed in the Great Kanto
              Earthquake of 1923 and in the air raids of 1945. Today, Tokyo
              offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment,
              culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be
              appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent
              museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common
              perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces
              in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its
              outskirts.

              Tokyo is the largest urban economy in the world by gross domestic
              product, and is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization
              and World Cities Research Network. Part of an industrial region
              that includes the cities of Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba, Tokyo
              is Japan's leading center of business and finance. In 2019, it
              hosted 36 of the Fortune Global 500 companies. In 2020, it ranked
              fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index, behind New York
              City, London, and Shanghai. Tokyo has the world's tallest tower
              Tokyo Skytree and the world's largest underground floodwater
              diversion facility MAOUDC. Tokyo is an international center of
              research and development and is represented by several major
              universities, notably the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is
              the central hub for Japan's Shinkansen bullet train system, and
              the city is served by an extensive network of rail and subways.
              Notable districts of Tokyo include Chiyoda (the site of the
              Imperial Palace), Shinjuku (the city's administrative center), and
              Shibuya (a commercial, cultural and business hub).

              Tokyo, as the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest
              domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation.
              However, its airspace has been under the US military's exclusive
              control after World War II. Public transportation within Tokyo is
              dominated by an extensive network of clean and efficient trains
              and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails
              and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62
              electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.
              Shibuya Crossing is the "world’s busiest pedestrian crossing",
              with circa 3,000 people crossing at a time. As a result of World
              War II, Japanese planes are generally forbidden to fly over Tokyo.
              Therefore, Japan constructed airports outside Tokyo. Narita
              International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for
              international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan
              Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this
              airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at Ōta, offers
              domestic and international flights.
